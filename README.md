<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm John O'Connell</h1>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ***My seemingly endless backlog of projects.***
  - Primarily focused on InspectorGadget and a home task manager I can't think of a snappy name for.

- 🌱 I’m currently focused on learning **Everything I can about MEAN stack development.**
  - Time to explore the other side! :musical_note: Stacks on stacks on stacks. :musical_note:

- 👨‍💻 Check out my projects on [My Website](https://jtocodes.com)!

- 💬 Ask me about **Anything! I'd love to have a chat.**
